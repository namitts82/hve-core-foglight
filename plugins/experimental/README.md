|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **experimental/experiment-designer**           | MVE domain knowledge and coaching conventions for the Experiment Designer agent                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **experimental/graphify**                      | Conventions for consuming graphify-out/ knowledge-graph evidence inside the RPI workflow                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **experimental/mural/mural-bootstrap**         | Fresh-session Mural bootstrap requirements for doctor checks, credential backend selection, and safe escalation before Mural tool use.                                                                                                                      |
| **experimental/mural/mural-destinations**      | Open destination registry for Mural extractor writeback: registered adapters, intent axis, and per-destination loop-closure metrics.                                                                                                                        |
| **experimental/mural/mural-human-record**      | Mural is the durable record of human conversation; AI never silently authors decisions and AI contribution must remain visible somewhere durable.                                                                                                           |
| **experimental/mural/mural-log-hygiene**       | Operator log-hygiene contract for Mural customizations: never echo raw URLs, Azure SAS query strings, OAuth tokens, or Authorization headers; the skill _redact() is a defense-in-depth backstop, not a license to log.                                     |
| **experimental/mural/mural-seeding-patterns**  | Cross-cutting Mural seeding conventions: duplicate-then-populate, source-artifact-to-area binding, anchor inheritance, probe-before-bulk, z-order visibility (detection-only), layout primitives applied across DT, RAI, and UX/UI workflows.               |
| **experimental/mural/mural-writeback-hygiene** | Writeback hygiene rules for Mural: tags, hyperlinks, and parentId are the only stable channels; reserved tags are protected; tag manifests are re-applied defensively.                                                                                      |
| **experimental/mural/mural-writing-style**     | Asymmetric writing style for Mural: outbound (writing into Mural) is sticky-concise; inbound (extracting from Mural) is context-hydrated.                                                                                                                   |
| **experimental/pptx**                          | Shared conventions for PowerPoint Builder agent, subagent, and powerpoint skill                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **shared/hve-core-location**                   | Important: hve-core is the repository containing this instruction file; Guidance: if a referenced prompt, instructions, agent, or script is missing in the current directory, fall back to this hve-core location by walking up this file's directory tree. |
