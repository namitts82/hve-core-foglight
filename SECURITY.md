<!-- BEGIN MICROSOFT SECURITY.MD V0.0.9 BLOCK -->

Microsoft takes the security of our software products and services seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, which include [Microsoft](https://github.com/Microsoft), [Azure](https://github.com/Azure), [DotNet](https://github.com/dotnet), [AspNet](https://github.com/aspnet) and [Xamarin](https://github.com/xamarin).

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Microsoft-owned repository that meets [Microsoft's definition of a security vulnerability](https://aka.ms/security.md/definition), please report it to us as described below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) at [https://msrc.microsoft.com/create-report](https://aka.ms/security.md/msrc/create-report).

If you prefer to submit without logging in, send email to [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com).  If possible, encrypt your message with our PGP key; please download it from the [Microsoft Security Response Center PGP Key page](https://aka.ms/security.md/msrc/pgp).

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Additional information can be found at [microsoft.com/msrc](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc).

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

If you are reporting for a bug bounty, more complete reports can contribute to a higher bounty award. Please visit our [Microsoft Bug Bounty Program](https://aka.ms/security.md/msrc/bounty) page for more details about our active programs.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Policy

Microsoft follows the principle of [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://aka.ms/security.md/cvd).

## Verifying Release Integrity

HVE Core releases are cryptographically signed using GitHub Artifact Attestations. This establishes provenance and allows you to verify that release artifacts were built from this repository's official CI/CD pipeline.

### Verification Steps

1. Install the GitHub CLI if not already available:

   ```bash
   # Windows (winget)
   winget install GitHub.cli

   # macOS (Homebrew)
   brew install gh
   ```

2. Download the release artifact (replace `<version>` with the release tag, e.g., `v1.2.0`):

   ```bash
   gh release download <version> -R microsoft/hve-core -p '*.vsix'
   ```

3. Verify the attestation:

   ```bash
   # VSIX extension package
   gh attestation verify hve-core-<version>.vsix -R microsoft/hve-core \
     --signer-workflow microsoft/hve-core/.github/workflows/extension-provenance.yml

   # Plugin ZIP package (replace <plugin-id> with the collection id)
   gh attestation verify <plugin-id>.zip -R microsoft/hve-core \
     --signer-workflow microsoft/hve-core/.github/workflows/extension-provenance.yml
   ```

The GitHub Release is the canonical verification surface for SLSA and Sigstore provenance. There is no Marketplace-native provenance channel; the Marketplace publishes the same attested VSIX by using `vsce publish --packagePath`, and Marketplace integrity is covered by the Marketplace signature that VS Code verifies at install.

A successful verification confirms:

* The artifact was built from the microsoft/hve-core repository
* The build occurred in GitHub Actions
* The artifact has not been modified since signing

### Verifying the SBOM

Each release includes a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) in SPDX 2.3 JSON format, cryptographically attested using Sigstore. For verification steps, download instructions, inspection commands, and SPDX field reference, see the [SBOM Verification Guide](docs/security/sbom-verification.md).

### Verifying the VEX Document

Each release publishes an OpenVEX v0.2.0 vulnerability exploitability document (`hve-core.openvex.json`) that records whether known vulnerabilities in bundled components affect HVE Core. The VEX document and its predicate-attestation are generated by the dedicated reusable workflow `microsoft/hve-core/.github/workflows/vex-attest.yml`, and they are cryptographically attested using Sigstore. Verify the VEX document and its predicate over the dependency SBOM with the signer-workflow pin:

```bash
gh attestation verify hve-core.openvex.json -R microsoft/hve-core \
  --signer-workflow microsoft/hve-core/.github/workflows/vex-attest.yml

gh attestation verify dependencies.spdx.json -R microsoft/hve-core \
  --signer-workflow microsoft/hve-core/.github/workflows/vex-attest.yml \
  --predicate-type https://openvex.dev/ns/v0.2.0
```

For download, verification, status interpretation, and how to apply it with Trivy or Grype, see the [VEX Verification Guide](docs/security/vex-verification.md).

### Release Artifact Formats

Each attested artifact produces a set of companion files uploaded alongside the primary asset:

| Suffix           | Format                 | Purpose                                        |
|------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `.spdx.json`     | SPDX 2.3 JSON          | Software Bill of Materials                     |
| `.sigstore.json` | Sigstore bundle (JSON) | Cryptographic attestation envelope             |
| `.intoto.jsonl`  | in-toto DSSE envelope  | Provenance statement extracted from the bundle |
| `.openvex.json`  | OpenVEX v0.2.0 JSON    | Vulnerability exploitability statements (VEX)  |

The `.sigstore.json` bundle contains the full Sigstore verification material. The `.intoto.jsonl` file is the DSSE envelope extracted from the bundle for tools that consume in-toto provenance directly.

### What Gets Signed

| Artifact               | Channel         | Signed                |
|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| VSIX extension package | GitHub Releases | Yes                   |
| Plugin ZIP package     | GitHub Releases | Yes                   |
| Per-extension SBOM     | GitHub Releases | Yes                   |
| Per-plugin SBOM        | GitHub Releases | Yes                   |
| Dependency SBOM        | GitHub Releases | Yes                   |
| VEX document           | GitHub Releases | Yes                   |
| Dependency diff        | GitHub Releases | No                    |
| VS Code Marketplace    | Stable          | Marketplace signature |
| VS Code Marketplace    | Pre-Release     | Marketplace signature |
